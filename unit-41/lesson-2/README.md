### Communication
### Grammar

#### What does he like? vs What's he like?

We use **what does he like?** to find out about what someone likes or dislikes.

- He likes football.
- He dislike hotpot.

And use **what's he like?** to find out about someone's personality.

- He's the one with black hair.
- He's cheerful.

#### For + -ing

We use **for + -ing** when we want to talk about the purpose of something - the reason why something is used.

- What is the bookshelf for?
  => The bookshelf is for storing my books.
- What is this money for?
  => This money is for spending on vacation.
- What's the hairdryer for?
  => The hairdryer is for drying my hair

**BUT** we use the infinitive if we want to talk about the purpose of someone or something.

- I use this hairdryer **to dry** my hair.
- I use this motorbike **to go** to work.
- It use gas **to start** its engine.
