## Lesson 1

### Communication
### Grammar

#### Infinitives after verbs

We can use the infinitive (to + verb) of certain verbs after common verbs.

For example:

- I want _to go_.
- He agreed _to do_ it.
- She promised _to meet_ him.
- They offered _to help_.

Negative:

- I agreed to _not_ say anything.

Common verbs: agree, ask, begin, decide, hope, like, love, offer, prefer, promise, refuse, seem, start, try, want, wish

#### Reported speech

**tell / ask** + object + present/past verb tense.

For example:

- She _told me_ she's unhappy.
- He _told me_ he's leaving.
- I _asked him_ if I was late.

Notes:

Change to past tense: 
- I want some food. He told me he _wanted_ some food.

Keep original tense if it's still true:

- I'm quiting my job. She told me she _is quiting_ her job.

Use with the infinitive:

- He asked me _to help_ him.
- They told me _to come_ to office.

Change the pronouns in the reported speech:

- "Bring _me my_ report", he told me. He told me to bring _him his_ report.
- "Can I take you to dinner?" she asked. She asked me if she _could_ take _me_ to dinner.
